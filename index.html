			<h3>ONLINE GIVING</h3>
			<P>The truth is giving tithes and offerings is that we bring ourselves closer to Him (God) when we give. Jesus says in Matthew 6:21, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Giving tithes and offerings puts our love for God before our worldly wealth and shows that our heart is always with Him.
